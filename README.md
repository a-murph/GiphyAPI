# Giphy API Gif Search

This was created as homework for Week 6 of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

## Summary

This is a program that pulls 10 gifs at a time from Giphy using their API and dislays them on the page.

## How To Use

The program creates a number of buttons with search terms attached. To search Giphy for a given tag, click on the corresponding button.

* There are 10 pre-made buttons, with search parameters based on some of my favorite video games.
* To add a new button with your own search parameter, enter the parameter in the text box to the right of the buttons and then click "Add Button".
  * This will create a new button with the given terms, and clicking on the new button will produce 10 gifs from Giphy just like the premade buttons.
* The gifs displayed are the 10 most recent gifs submitted to Giphy that match the search.
